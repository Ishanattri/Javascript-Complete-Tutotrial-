chinese or mandarin: 'MOST number of native speakers!'
spanish: '2nd place in number of native speakers'
english: '3rd place'
hindi: 'Number 4'
arabic: '5th most spoken language'
for all other simply log 'Great language too :D'


--------------LECTURE: The Conditional (Ternary) Operator-------------------
1. If your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator 
to log a string like this to the console: 'Portugal's population is above average'. 
Otherwise, simply log 'Portugal's population is below average'. Notice how only
one word changes between these two sentences!
2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 
130. See the different results, and set the population back to original
